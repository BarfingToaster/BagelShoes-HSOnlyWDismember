# BagelShoes-HSOnlyWDismember
Bagelshoes - Headshots Only with Dismemberment.
This mod is for use with the PC game 7 Days to Die. It can be installed server side only and works for all players.
=========================================Features==========================

Headshots Only with Dismemberment is a server-side xml configuration mod that mitigates 
damage to zombie bodies and multiplies damage to zombie heads by 1.5x. This allows the 
zombies to be dismembered fully before killing them. As long as the head is attached,
the zombie is alive. So go ahead, chop that biker up into a tiny torso/head creature and
watch him wiggle towards you.
